#### WikifyDocs: [Addressing Ambiguity Through Definitions in API Documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oDjmzWjjGVzaJ3cu7MyzKrwxKJr-Ne88/view?usp=sharing)

 - Application Programming Interface (API) documentation is meant to help developers understand and use the functionalities of an API. It is often assumed that developers who refer to API documentation have an inherent degree of knowledge of its terminology. However, this approach overlooks the various expertise levels that developers consulting documentation might have. Our goal is to bridge the gap between knowledge profiles of API developers and API users, by identifying potentially ambiguous vocabulary and providing contextual definitions. The presented tool is part of an overall effort to automatically improve documentation in the software engineering community.

#### MindScribe: [Reflective Inquiry through Scaffolded Storytelling for Low-Income and Multilingual Early Childhood Communities](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3177823)

	ACM International Conference on Human robot Interactions, Chicago, IL, USA
	Student Design Competition Accepted Entry

 - When young children create, they are exploring their emerging skills by engaging with the world. When young children reflect, they are deepening their learning experiences by extracting insights. And when young children share, they are strengthening their community by creating opportunities for collaboration. To support such constructionist learning, we present MindScribe, an affordable interactive robotic object that engages preliterate children inmin reflective inquiry. As children create artifacts, MindScribe invites them to "tell a story" about their creation---in any language. And through scaffolded questioning, MindScribe elicits childrenÂ»s insights into their creative discoveries. Together, they spark child-led communication and innovation in early learning communities.
